# Mr.Weather

AS A traveler I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs WHEN I search for a city😎 THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history☁️ WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city✅ THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index✅ WHEN I view the UV index🌡️ THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe🙌 WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city🐣 THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity WHEN I click on a city in the search history✅ THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city✔️
